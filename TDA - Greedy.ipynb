    "You are consulting for a trucking company that does a large amount of business shipping packages between New York and Boston. The volume is high enough that they have to send a number of trucks each day between the two locations. Trucks have a fixed limit W on the maximum amount of weight they are allowed to carry. Boxes arrive at the New York station one by one, and each package i has a weight wi. The trucking station is quite small, so at most one truck can be at the station at any time. Company policy requires that boxes are shipped in the order they arrive; otherwise, a customer might get upset upon seeing a box that arrived after his make it to Boston faster. At the moment, the company is using a simple greedy algorithm for packing: they pack boxes in the order they arrive, and whenever the next box does not fit, they send the truck on its way.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they wonder if they might be using too many trucks, and they want your opinion on whether the situation can be improved. Here is how they are thinking. Maybe one could decrease the number of trucks needed by sometimes sending off a truck that was less full, and in this way allow the next few trucks to be better packed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prove that, for a given set of boxes with specified weights, the greedy algorithm currently in use actually minimizes the number of trucks that are needed. Your proof should follow the type of analysis we used for the Interval Scheduling Problem: it should establish the optimality of this greedy packing algorithm by identifying a measure under which it “stays ahead” of all other solutions.\n",

The plan is to send the contestants out in a staggered fashion, via the following rule: the contestants must use the pool one at a time. In other words, first one contestant swims the 20 laps, gets out, and starts biking. As soon as this first person is out of the pool, a second contestant begins swimming the 20 laps; as soon as he or she is out and starts biking, a third contestant begins swimming . . . and so on.)\n",

    "As a simple first step, they’ve written a program called status_check that, when invoked, runs for a few seconds and records various pieces of logging information about all the sensitive processes running on the system at that moment. (We’ll model each invocation of status_check as lasting for only this single point in time.) What they’d like to do is to run status_check as few times as possible during the day, but enough that for each sensitive process P, status_check is invoked at least once during the execution of process P.\n",

    "(b) While you were designing your algorithm, the security consultants were engaging in a little back-of-the-envelope reasoning. “Suppose we can find a set of k sensitive processes with the property that no two are ever running at the same time. Then clearly your algorithm will need to invoke status_check at least k times: no one invocation of status_check can handle more than one of these processes.”\n",

    "This is true, of course, and after some further discussion, you all begin wondering whether something stronger is true as well, a kind of converse to the above argument. Suppose that k∗ is the largest value of k such that one can find a set of k sensitive processes with no two ever running at the same time. Is it the case that there must be a set of k∗ times at which you can run status_check so that some invocation occurs during the execution of each sensitive process? (In other words, the kind of argument in the previous paragraph is really the only thing forcing you to need a lot of invocations of status_ check.)

More precisely, the Web site answers queries of the following form: given an edge e = (v, w) connecting two sites v and w, and given a proposed starting time t from location v, the site will return a value fe(t), the predicted arrival time at w. The Web site guarantees that fe(t) ≥ t for all edges e and all times t (you can’t travel backward in time), and that fe(t) is a monotone increasing function of t (that is, you do not arrive earlier by starting later). Other than that, the functions fe(t) may be arbitrary.
