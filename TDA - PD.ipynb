The basic question, each week, is whether to take on a low-stress job or a high-stress job.\n",

On the other hand, it’s okay for them to take a low- stress job in week i even if they have done a job (of either type) in week i − 1.\n",

(It’s okay to choose a high-stress job in week 1.) The value of the plan is determined in the natural way: for each i, you add li to the value if you choose “low-stress” in week i, and you add hi to the value if you choose “high-stress” in week i.

    "As some of you know well, and others of you may be interested to learn, a number of languages (including Chinese and Japanese) are written without spaces between the words. Consequently, software that works with text written in these languages must address the word segmentation problem—inferring likely boundaries between consecutive words in the ext. If English were written without spaces, the analogous problem would consist of taking a string like “meetateight” and deciding that the best segmentation is “meet at eight” (and not “me et at eight,” or “meet ate ight,” or any of a huge number of even less plausible alternatives). How could we automate this process?\n",
    "A simple approach that is at least reasonably effective is to find a segmentation that simply maximizes the cumulative “quality” of its indi- vidual constituent words. Thus, suppose you are given a black box that, for any string of letters x = x1x2 . . . xk, will return a number quality(x). This number can be either positive or negative; larger numbers correspond to more plausible English words. (So quality(“me”) would be positive, while quality(“ght”) would be negative.)\n",
    "Given a long string of letters y = y1y2 . . . yn, a segmentation of y is a partition of its letters into contiguous blocks of letters; each block corre- sponds to a word in the segmentation. The total quality of a segmentation is determined by adding up the qualities of each of its blocks. (So we’d get the right answer above provided that quality(“meet”) + quality(“at”) + quality(“eight”) was greater than the total quality of any other segmenta- tion of the string.)\n",

    "The problem of searching for cycles in graphs arises naturally in financial trading applications. Consider a firm that trades shares in n different companies. For each pair i ̸= j, they maintain a trade ratio rij, meaning that one share of i trades for rij shares of j. Here we allow the rate r to be fractional; that is, r = 2 means that you can trade three shares of i to get ij 3 two shares of j.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trading cycle for a sequence of shares i1, i2, . . . , ik consists of successively trading shares in company i1 for shares in company i2, then shares in company i2 for shares i3, and so on, finally trading shares in ik back to shares in company i1. After such a sequence of trades, one ends up with shares in the same company i1 that one starts with. Trading around a cycle is usually a bad idea, as you tend to end up with fewer shares than you started with. But occasionally, for short periods of time, there are opportunities to increase shares. We will call such a cycle an opportunity cycle, if trading along the cycle increases the number of shares. This happens exactly if the product of the ratios along the cycle is above 1. In analyzing the state of the market, a firm engaged in trading would like to know if there are any opportunity cycles.\n",

    "A large collection of mobile wireless devices can naturally form a network in which the devices are the nodes, and two devices x and y are connected by an edge if they are able to directly communicate with each other (e.g., by a short-range radio link). Such a network of wireless devices is a highly dynamic object, in which edges can appear and disappear over time as the devices move around. For instance, an edge (x, y) might disappear as x and y move far apart from each other and lose the ability to communicate directly.\n",

    "In a network that changes over time, it is natural to look for efficient ways of maintaining a path between certain designated nodes. There are two opposing concerns in maintaining such a path: we want paths that are short, but we also do not want to have to change the path frequently as the network structure changes. (That is, we’d like a single path to continue working, if possible, even as the network gains and loses edges.) Here is a way we might model this problem.\n",

    "Suppose we have a set of mobile nodes V, and at a particular point in time there is a set E0 of edges among these nodes.
